# Product Requirements Document: Download Project Plan

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a new feature that allows students to download their full project plan, including tasks and corresponding task hints, in an Excel format. The primary goal is to enable students to view their project details offline.

## 2. Goals
*   To provide students with an offline accessible version of their project plan, task list, and task hints.
*   To allow students to download project data in a structured, user-friendly Excel format.

## 3. User Stories
*   **As a student, I want to download my project plan with all tasks and task hints, so that I can view my project details offline.**

## 4. Functional Requirements
1.  The system must display a "Download" button on the student dashboard, within the project task list view, in the top right corner of the "Project Plan" section (as indicated by the red-marked area in the provided image).
2.  Upon clicking the "Download" button, the student must be able to download an Excel file containing their full project plan.
3.  The Excel file must include all task fields associated with the particular project.
4.  The Excel file must include all task hints for each task.
5.  All hints for a single task must be concatenated and displayed within a single cell in the Excel file.
6.  The data in the Excel file should be presented in a clear and student-friendly manner.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
*   This feature will not include functionality for other user types (e.g., teachers, administrators) to download project plans.
*   This feature will not include advanced reporting or customization options for the Excel export beyond the specified fields.
*   This feature will not involve integration with external project management tools.

## 6. Design Considerations
*   **Button Placement:** The download button should be placed in the top right corner of the "Project Plan" section, as per the provided image. The specific UI component should align with existing design patterns in the application.
*   **Excel Formatting:** The Excel file should be visually appealing and easy to navigate for students. Column headers should be clear and descriptive.

## 7. Technical Considerations
*   The task details and their hints should be fetched from the "assigned project collection."
*   Consider using a client-side library for generating the Excel file to minimize server load, if feasible.
*   Ensure proper handling of large project plans to prevent performance issues during download.

## 8. Success Metrics
*   Successful download of the project task list with all associated data (tasks and hints).
*   Positive student feedback regarding the usefulness and ease of use of the download feature.

## 9. Open Questions
*   Are there any specific character limits or formatting rules for task hints that might affect their display in a single Excel cell?
*   What naming convention should be used for the downloaded Excel file? (e.g., `[Project Name]_Project_Plan.xlsx`)
*   Are there any specific error messages or user feedback mechanisms required if the download fails?
